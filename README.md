## Spring Security REST API with 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)

This project is a **Spring Boot** application that secures REST APIs using **Spring Security**, **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, and **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** with **Google Authenticator**.

### Features
- User registration and login
- Passwords hashed using **BCrypt**
- JWT-based authentication for securing APIs
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** using **TOTP** (Time-Based One-Time Password)
- Google Authenticator generates a 6-digit OTP every 30 seconds
- Server verifies OTP using a shared secret
- Only on valid OTP, JWT is issued

### How 2FA Works
1. When a user registers, the backend generates a **secret key** and a **QR code URL**.
2. The user scans this QR code using **Google Authenticator**.
3. During login:
    - First, the user is authenticated using **username and password**.
    - Then, the user must enter a valid **OTP** generated by the authenticator app.
4. If the OTP is valid, the server responds with a **JWT token**.
5. The token is then used to access protected REST endpoints.
